Robison Jeffer''s once said, &quot;Big Sur is the greatest meeting of land and sea in the world,&quot; but the highlights are only accessible on foot.</p>
 <p>Our 3-day tour allows you to choose from multiple hikes led by experienced guides during the day, while comfortably situated in the evenings at the historic Big Sur River Inn. Take a tranquil walk to the coastal waterfall at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Par or hike to the Married Redwoods. If you''re prepared for a more strenuous climb, try Ollason''s Peak in Toro Park. An optional 4th day includes admission to the Henry Miller Library and the Point Reyes Lighthouse.</p>
