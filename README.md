This is from a tutorial I took as a refresher course, the tutorial only covered the Blog Controller and some other basic things for an HTML to MVC conversion. 

I went ahead and converted the rest of the site, many pages were missing so I only converted what existed.

Changes can be found in the Updates.txt and the About page.
